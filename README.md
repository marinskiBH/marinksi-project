We created this group because we first met on a Brawlhalla server called Donut Dudes, where I serve as a co-owner. It all started with three friends, MarinskiBH, TheLegendEv, and CSZ Sceps, who shared a common goal: to track their daily progress. Our collective aspiration is twofold: to achieve financial success and eventually meet face-to-face. This group serves as our anchor, ensuring constant communication and mutual support. Together, we believe we can overcome any challenge that comes our way.
